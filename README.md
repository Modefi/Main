# Modefi Github Development Details

<br>

Welcome to the official GitHub page for Modefi

At first glance, you might find our repository a bit sparse. This is because our main repositories are temporarily hosted on GitLab under a private setting as we refine our On Demand Oracle to exit its beta phase. Every product we've created is original, with no reliance on forking or cloning, underscoring the meticulous attention and pride we invest in our work. For security reasons and to safeguard our intellectual property, we have made it a priority to withhold our codebase from public view until it is fully prepared for mainnet deployment. This strategic decision allows us to maintain a competitive edge.


To keep our community informed, we have consistently shared updates on our developmental milestones and achievements. Notably, our commit activity ranks us among the top 3 blockchain projects in terms of development activity, as evidenced on Cryptomiso.
